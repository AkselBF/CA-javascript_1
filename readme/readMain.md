(index.html, style.css, script.js)

The main page consists of Three things at first glance: 
- The page title 
- A link to the contact page
- A search field to get books

The link to the contact page is pretty self explanatory. Details about the
contact page will be noted in "readContact.md".

The more relevant feature is the search bar and the "Run"-button that runs it. 
When searching for a book title, such as: "room" or "romeo" then click
on the "Run"-button, books with similar titles will appear. 
Results can still appear by searching nothing.

Clicking on one of the books will lead to a more detailed page of 
the selected book (details.html/css/js). 

More details about this page will be noted in "readDetails.md".
