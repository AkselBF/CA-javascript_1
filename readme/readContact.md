(contact.html, contact.css, contact.js)

This page can be accessed via the (index.html/script.js) page and leads
back to it by clicking on the text link at the bottom left corner.

The contact page serves as a way to validate contact information the user 
taps in. There are four types of fields/inputs:
- Full name
- Subject
- E-mail
- Address

Each input require a minimum amount of words or the correct way to write it. 

Should any of the requirements be missing after clicking on the "submit" button, 
the form will NOT inform the user the submission passes. That, and the corresponding 
inputs will inform the user that something is missing. 

Should the form be submitted correctly however, an alert message will say the 
submission is a success, and a "Passed" wil also pop up on top of the form.
